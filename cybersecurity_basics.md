# Basics of Cybersecurity Cheat Sheet

## Overview

### What is Information Security?
Information security focuses on the value of the information being protected rather than how it is being protected. It encompasses physical security and cybersecurity. Cybersecurity tends to focus on the security of digital systems but should not be limited to digital elements, as most attacks have human and physical factors as well.

## Offense: Threat Actor Groups

### What are Threat Actor Groups?
Cybersecurity professionals must understand different types of threat actor groups that vary in motivation, resources, and techniques. The five main types of cyber attacker groups are:

| Group                     | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
